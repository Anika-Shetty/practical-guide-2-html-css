      <p>
        When I give lectures on college campuses, the most difficult question 
        I am asked is this: “I want to pursue my dream, but my parents want me 
        to do something different. What should I do?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I can relate. What would have made me happy as a young person was to 
        be a writer and study literature. What would have made my parents 
        happy was for me to become a doctor like my brother, who went to 
        Harvard and Stanford. How could I come home to my refugee parents, 
        who worked seven days a week in their grocery store, and tell them that 
        I wanted to read Jane Austen and the Romantic poets, and major in English, 
        a language they didn’t speak in their own home?
